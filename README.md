# 🇰🇷 Made in Korea

> 한국인 개발자가 만들거나 메인으로 기여한 오픈소스 프로젝트 목록입니다. (이 레포지토리는 [made-in-ukraine](https://github.com/chernivtsijs/made-in-ukraine)에 영감을 받았습니다.)

## 동기

오픈소스 소프트웨어는 다문화적입니다. 소프트웨어를 설치하고 사용할 때, 누가 만들었는지 보통 신경 쓰지 않습니다. 그럼에도 불구하고, 해당 소프트웨어를 개발한 사람은 그들만의 국가 및 문화적 맥락을 가지고 있습니다.

많은 훌륭한 한국인 개발자들이 오픈소스 프로젝트에 기여하고 있습니다. 얼마나 많은 한국인 개발자들이 글로벌 소프트웨어 문화에 기여하고 있는지 알게 된다면 같은 한국인으로서 매우 자랑스러울 것입니다.

이 레포지토리에 있는 프로젝트 목록은 아래 기준에 부합합니다.

1. 프로젝트를 만든 사람 혹은 메인테이너가 한국에서 태어났거나 자신을 한국인이라고 규정한다.
2. 프로젝트가 단체 소속이고, 한국인 개발자가 기여자 상위 5명 이내에 있다.

> 위 조건에 부합한다면, PR을 보내주세요!
